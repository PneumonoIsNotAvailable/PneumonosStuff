Adds some assorted stuff I didn't feel deserved its own mod. Mostly for a server I'm on. All of these features are configurable, so when you look at something here and think it's awful, you can just turn it off.

- Plushies
  - Can be cuddled which heals you 
  - Bl√•haj! Djungelskog!
- Rubber ducks
  - quack.ogg
  - Can be triggered with redstone
  - Calibrated Rubber Ducks can have the quack pitches changed via right-click, like note blocks.
  - Includes a 'Ducks Quacked' statistic, because yes
- Cat Ears
  - It's funny because they're Cat Ears
  - Can be enchanted with any helmet enchantments, but provide no protection on their own
  - Can be enchanted with curse of binding and can be equipped with dispensers. You know what to do.
- Beacon range configurability
  - Self-explanatory
- Elytra disabling
  - Works by making them always "broken", so they're still collectable as trophy items and for the advancement
- Jukebox looping
  - Jukeboxes will only loop discs if there isn't a hopper underneath, so that hoppers still do their thing
- Conduits apply 'Conduit Protection' when on land
  - Both Conduit Protection and Conduit Power prevent hydrophobic origins from the Origins mod from taking damage from water
